# test-pmd

From the [test-pmd user guide](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/testpmd_app_ug/intro.html):
> The testpmd application can be used to test the DPDK in a packet forwarding mode and also to access NIC hardware features such as Flow Director. It also serves as a example of how to build a more fully-featured application using the DPDK SDK.

This project here is just with a few added bells and whistles that not everybody may want.
Based on dpdk release [v17.08](http://dpdk.org/browse/dpdk-stable/?h=17.08).
